This is a set of (hopefully anonymized) replication materials for the draft manuscript "Shooting the messenger: Perceptions of expert credibility after making knowledge claims on punitive responses to individuals convicted of sexual offenses (RJQY-2022-0317). 

There is a data file (.sav), and a .R script. To replicate analyses presented in the paper, save the data and script to your machine, preferably to the same directory. The .R script will then read in the data and replicate the analysis. Individual analysis components (and tables where they are presented) are annotated within the script.
